# Mental Health Monitoring System Simulation

This directory contains tools for simulating the AI-based real-time personalized mental health monitoring system. The simulation allows for testing the system's capabilities without requiring the actual hardware components.

## Simulation Components

- `sensor_simulator.py`: Generates synthetic biosensor data that simulates ear-insertable sensor readings
- `behavior_simulator.py`: Simulates user behavior patterns (smartphone usage, activity, sleep)
- `ai_pipeline_simulator.py`: Simulates the AI analysis and diagnosis pipeline
- `treatment_simulator.py`: Simulates the generation and delivery of treatment programs
- `visualization_tools.py`: Tools for visualizing the simulation results

## Usage

The simulation can be run with different parameters to test various scenarios, including:
- Different mental health conditions
- Various user profiles and behaviors
- Different treatment response patterns
- System performance under different loads
